## About this repo

This repository holds the markdown book for the Atomic Data standard.

You can run it locally using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook)

# This requires at least Rust 1.39 and Cargo to be installed. Once you have installed Rust, type the following in the terminal:
cargo install mdbook
# Install mdbook-linkcheck to prevent broken links in your markdown.
cargo install mdbook-linkcheck
# Serve at localhost:3000, updates when files change.
mdbook serve
