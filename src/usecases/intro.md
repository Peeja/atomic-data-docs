# Atomic Data Usecases

Most of this book is either abstract or very technical, but this section aims to be different.
Usecases are concrete examples of things that can be built with Atomic Data.
Although you could use Atomic Data for pretty much any type of application, it is especially valuable where re-use, standardization, and ownership are imporant.
The usecases are designed to use the unique characteristics of Atomic Data.
