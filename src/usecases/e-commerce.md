# Atomic Data for e-commerce

## Highly personalized and customizable search

Searching for things on the internet is still not that great.
If we want to buy a jacket, we see tonnes of jackets that are not even available in our own size.
Every single website has their own way of searching and filtering.

Imagine creating a search description in _one_ application, and sending that to _multiple suppliers_, after you'll receive a fully personalized and optimized list of articles.
No duplicate articles, every article with price comparison.

Browsing in an application that you like to use, not bound to any one specific store, that doesn't track you, and doesn't show advertisements.
It is a tool that helps you to find what you need, and it is the job of producers to accurately describe their products in a format that your product browser can understand.

How do we get there?

Well, for starters, producers and suppliers will need to reach a consensus on _how to describe their articles_.
This is not new; for many products, we already have a common language.
Shoes have a shoe size, televisions have a screen size in diagonal inches, brightness is measured in nits, etc.
Describing this in a machine-readable and predictable format as data is the next logical step.
This is, of course, where Atomic Schema could help.
Atomic-server could be the connected, open source database that suppliers use to describe their products as data.

## Product specific updates after purchase

Imagine buying an external battery pack with a production error.
All units with a serial number between 1561168 and 1561468 have a serious error, where overcharging could lead to spontaneous combustion.
This is something that you'd like to know.
But how would the _manufacturer_ of that resource know where to find you?
Well, if your Atomic Server would have a list of all the things that you've bought, it could subscribe to safety updates from all manufacturers.
When any of these manufacturers would publish a safety warning about a product that you possess, you'll get an alert.

## Product lifecycle insights

Imagine buying a product, and being able to see where each part came from.
